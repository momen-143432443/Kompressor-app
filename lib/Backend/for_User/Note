why we using GetxController?
for example, if we create a simple class with variables and use it in somewhere else, we must to create a new instance, example :-

class User{
    final  int varr = 0;
    final String strVar = 'fgvsejkgvn';
        
        void sum(int a,int b){
            return a+b;
        }
  final user = User();
}

and it will a lot of space and time.
But we use GetxController, it's allow to and some functions and wrap with functions or triggers, and we can create a new instance with simple class,
but instead create instance again and again, we create it for a once
